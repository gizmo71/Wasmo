RudderTillerzmo
===============

Until MSFS and/or the FBW team can separate the tiller and rudder controls fully,
this standalone WASM module can provide an approximation of the real A320's behaviour.

In order to use this, map your rudder pedals to the `RUDDER AXIS` input, and your
tiller (I use my joystick's twist axis) to `RUDDER AXIS LEFT`.
